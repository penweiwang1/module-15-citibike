## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to use visualizations and to use the Citibike program, as an example, to gather a deeper understanding of the users, product demands, and other data points of a bike-sharing program in order to  increase stakeholder engagement of starting a similar business for the city of Des Moines.

## Results: 
1. <img width="763" alt="1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115126898/215026909-cc077cad-4942-4f90-a758-2a229473a441.png">
The majority of users complete their trip and return the bikes within an hour, which can mean that bike availability probably  would not  be a problem since the user trips are short.

The user ratio of male to female is around 3 to 1.

Demand during the the weekdays are highest in the mornings between 8AM to 10 AM and in the afternoons between 5PM and 8PM. This is most likely due to the fact that people would use the bikes as transportation to help get to and from work as the majority of Americans work a 9-to-5. The demand stays higher than average throughout the weekends.

Even though the ratio of males is higher than that of females, both genders have a similar peak demand times for the bikes.

5. <img width="763" alt="5" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115126898/215026931-5e49f7bc-ef78-4f58-80ca-cf9feee7c73b.png">
The highest bike usage are on Thursdays by male subscibers with a total count of 259,136 rides.

Top starting locations for the citibike program is concentrated within the city center of lower/mid Manhattan where many offices, attractions, restaurants, and retail are located.

Top end locations were even more concentrated in lower/mid manhattan. Hotspots of bike usuage did not change durastically from top starting locations.



## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
### summary of results
The success of the citibike program can be seen by the sheer number of users in the hundred thousands and can be replicated by the proposed bike-sharing program in Des Moines. Although there were more male users than that of female, the behaviors in the demand of the bikes were very similar. The majority of the people used the bikes during the weekends and in the mornings between 8-10AM and evenings between 5-8PM, which can be attributed to people getting from home to work and vice versa. Most users also spend less than an hour per trip. This demand cycle can be applied to the proposed bike program for Des Moines in that a similar demand cycle can be predicted. Seeing that the concentraton of the starting and ending locations were in the city center, it would make sense that more bikes should be placed in the city center of Des Moines where most of the attractions and offices would be. 
### additional visualizations
1. User count by age group - helpful in determining target market and for marketing
2. maping the starting locations, filtering by usertype, and marking by size of usertype - can be easily seen which locations have higher number of subscribers/customers
